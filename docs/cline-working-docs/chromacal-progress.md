## Release and Distribution

### GitHub Actions Issues
- ❌ Investigate 403 error in release creation:
  - Unexpected behavior: Main branch builds succeed but tag builds fail
  - Error occurs only in release creation step, not in build process
  - Possible causes:
    - Different permission contexts between branch and tag builds
    - Repository release creation permissions
    - GitHub token scope limitations
  - Investigation needed:
    - Compare GitHub token permissions between contexts
    - Review Actions workflow permissions settings
    - Check repository release settings
    - Analyze differences in environment between branch/tag builds

### Package Metadata Improvements
- ✅ Update package identity:
  - Changed developer email to support@cookiecad.com
  - Improved application description
  - Fixed product name to "ChromaCal"
  - Updated metadata in:
    - package.json
    - electron-forge config
    - Application manifests
  - Ensured consistent branding across distribution files

### Credentials Management System
- ✅ Implemented proper credentials flow:
  - Added user-friendly error when credentials missing
  - Improved error handling and recovery
  - Added secure storage in user data directory
  - Implemented auto-copy of dev credentials
  - Added clear error messages and recovery steps

### Error Handling and User Experience
- ✅ Improved error handling:
  - Replaced cryptic ENOENT error with user-friendly message
  - Added proper error recovery flows
  - Implemented comprehensive error logging
  - Added:
    - Missing credentials detection
